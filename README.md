## Lab2: Adding LLM to Streamlit App
Now we have a web interface working, we will now add an LLM to our Streamlit app to have our simplified version of ChatGPT. We will be using [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) as the framework for this course. It provides easy abstractions and a wide varieties of data connectors and interfaces for everything LLM app development.

In this lab, we will be adding an Chat LLM to our Chainlit app using Langchain.

## Exercises

We will build on top of our existing Streamlit app code in `app/app.py` in the `app` folder. As in our previous app, we added some template code and instructions in `app/app.py`

1. Please go through the exercises in `app/app.py`. 

2. Please lanuch the application by running the following command on the Terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

## Solution

Please see `app/app.py`.

Alternatively, to launch the application, please run the following command on the Terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```
